# JAPAFGM

Just Another Pokemon App For Good Measure (phew!), or JAPAFGM is a frontend application that connects to a free pokemon GraphQl api, and facilitates the visualization and search of pokemons through a minimal...rushed interface.
This application was mainly developed with the aim of putting into practice React concepts such as the use of **Hooks, Unit Tests and TypeScript.**

## Features

**- IT SEARCHES POKEMONS**

## Possible Improvements

- [ ] Improve the design/ styling.
- [x] Extract the logic from the `PokemonInfo` component into a
      custom and generic `useAsync` hook.
